        <p>Being Geeky is one of the best platform for the online learning. With the best study material.Dummy text
            is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will later be
            filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text
            is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when
            writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in
            use by typesetters since the 16th century.</p>

                <h1>Documention</h1>
                <h2>All genuine Documentation at one place</h2>
                <p>Being Geeky helps the viewer to find all the required documentation at one place so that they need not
                    waste time to find offical documentation. The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is
                    said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which
                    more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy
                    text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The
                    advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
                    attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.

                    thus made dummy text better known. While in earlier times several lines of the Lorem Ipsum text
                    were repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today the full text of Cicero's 'De finibus' serves as the
                    basis for many dummy text or Lorem Ipsum generators. Based on 'De finibus', these generators
                    automatically create longer sections of the Lorem Ipsum text or various other filler texts.</p>

                            Ipsum text is now so widespread and commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy
                            text using the starting sequence "Lorem ipsum". Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum' is now
                            recognized by electronic pre-press systems and, when found, an alarm can be raised. This avoids a
                            publication going to print with overlooked dummy text.
